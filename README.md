# Characterizing-individual-Microcystis-colony-phycosphere-communities
This repository holds all metadata tables, scripts, and R code for the bioinformatic and statistical analysis associated with the manuscript: Individual Microcystis colonies harbor distinct bacterial communities that differ by Microcystis oligotype and with time.

The raw sequence data can be found in NCBI SRA under the following BioProjects:  
For the Microcystis colony sequences: PRJNA645738  
For whole water and <100 um community sequences from 2017-2019: PRJNA646259  
Note that the 2014 whole water community sequences were published as part of a later study. See the citation in the manuscript.
